# ego_network_inference

This repository houses example code and all neccessary functions to run the Ego Network Configuration (ENC) inferential introduced in: Smith, Jeffrey A. 2012. “Macrostructure from Microstructure: Generating Whole Systems from Ego Networks.” Sociological Methodology 42:155-205. See also: Smith, Jeffrey A. and G. Robin Gauthier 2020. “Estimating Contextual Effects from Ego Network Data”. Sociological Methodology. 50:215-275 doi: 10.1177/0081175020922879.

The inferential approach offers practical solution for researchers interested in global network structure where only sampled data can be collected. The basic idea is to take information from ego network data,like the number of partners named and the pattern of alter-alter ties, and generate networks that are consistent with the features found in the sampled ego network data. The generated networks represent a researcher’s best guess as to what the true network actually looks  like and can then be used to calculate key features of interest.
