# ego_network_inference

This repository houses example code and all neccessary functions to run the Ego Network Configuration (ENC) inferential introduced in: Smith, Jeffrey A. 2012. “Macrostructure from Microstructure: Generating Whole Systems from Ego Networks.” Sociological Methodology 42:155-205.

The basic idea is to take information from ego network data,like the number of partners named and the pattern of alter-alter ties, and generate networks that are consistent with the features found in the sampled ego network data. The generated networks represent a researcher’s best guess as to what the true network actually looks  like and can then be used to calculate key features of interest.
